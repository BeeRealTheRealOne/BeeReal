## Projektvision

Imagine going on a walk and you suddenly notice a small insect to your right caressing a flower. You take a picture and upload it to Instagram with the caption “Wish I would spot more of these; what type of insect is this anyways”. This data then gets flung into the world wide web and is probably lost forever. Even though the geolocation and picture could help science and biology identify the growth, shrinking and migration of insects.
This is where BeeReal comes into the picture. By uploading that photo and geolocation onto our platform, you supply critical data in the fight against insect extinction. At the same time the user gets gamified rewards for collecting all types of insects in your area, finding rare insects, or finding many insects. At last, the user gets educated on what type of insect this particular specimen is. The collected data can then be analyzed by scientists to find new insights into the fascinating world of insects. This project shall combine our love of nature with our fascination for data and ideally help fight insect extinction.
